# Bolina_project
Bolina is a fictitious responsive photography website, I structured the project based around BEM and SASS 7-1 Pattern methodologies. The design is inspired from one of PSD file from pinterest and I reimagined how website would behave in terms of responsiveness with animations.
Furthermore, the project is layed out with css-grid and css-flexbox (no floats, no clearfix hacks! yay!). Jquery and its plugins(waypoints.js and gmaps.js) are used for smooth on scrolls animations and to use google maps.

## Prerequisites/Installing

### NPM
Before doing live-server on your text editor to view the mock-up, please be sure to npm install on root folder. I inputted several scripts to compile sass files, compress, autoprefix, etc.
After you have successfully installed all packages listed on package.json, please type "npm run start" as it will compile sass files and automatically open browser (for my case, I used Firefox as my default as it has better visualization with css-grid).

## Live Demo

* Will deploy soon.
